# log2src

Mapping logs to source code to augment debugging, analysis, and understanding.

## log2src-dbg: a log driven debugger

Use logs generated by your application to drive a debugger and step through the source code.

### Features
- Automates the step of mapping the log statements back to the source code easing the cognitive burden while debugging.
- Will try to deduce the value of variables included in the log statement.
- Infers the call stack when possible based on an analysis of the source code.

### Use cases
There are some types of applications and situations where connecting a traditional debugger is not fast, easy, or possible. Some of the use cases this tool is intended to help are:
1. multi-threaded code: debuggers can impact how the ordering of threads sometimes making a bug challenging to reproduce when using a debugger
2. client server applications: stepping across machine boundaries requires orchestrating multiple debuggers and racing against client time outs
3. prod: trying to debug on prod is risky and requires access to the infrastructure
